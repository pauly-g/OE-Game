# Order Editing - The Game: Comprehensive Game Mechanics Documentation

## Core Gameplay Overview

"Order Editing - The Game" is a fast-paced arcade-style game where players handle customer order edits on a virtual conveyor belt. As a warehouse worker, your job is to collect various edits from stations around the warehouse and apply them to orders before they leave the conveyor belt.

## Game Objectives

- Apply the correct edits to each order box on the conveyor belt
- Complete as many orders as possible to maximize your score
- Unlock additional editing stations by completing orders
- Earn and use power-ups to handle peak order volumes
- Survive as long as possible without losing all your lives

## Core Mechanics

### Player Movement
- Player moves in four directions using arrow keys (‚Üë, ‚Üì, ‚Üê, ‚Üí)
- Character animations change based on direction and movement state
- Player is constrained to the screen boundaries
- Collision detection prevents walking through stations
- Cannot walk onto the conveyor belt (blocked by collision detection)
- Can carry up to 3 different types of edits simultaneously
- Player movement speed is set to 4 (reduced from the original 8 for better control)

### Player Character

- Has distinctive animations for idle and movement in all four directions
- Applies edits to orders when standing near them and pressing spacebar
- Previous position tracking prevents both sliding and walking through stations
- Animation frame rate is 8 frames per second (125ms per frame)
- Character sprite has 6 frames for each animation sequence

### Edit Handling Mechanics

- **Picking Up Edits**: 
  - Press spacebar when near a station to pick up an edit
  - Each station provides a specific type of edit
  - Player can collect up to 3 different edits at a time (no duplicates)
  - The edit icons follow the player with appropriate offsets based on direction
  - Warning message displays when trying to pick up a duplicate edit type

- **Applying Edits to Orders**:
  - Press spacebar when near an order to apply the carried edit
  - Edits are used in a first-in-first-out (FIFO) queue
  - The next edit to be used is visually highlighted
  - If the edit is valid for the order, it will be applied with a visual checkmark
  - If the edit is invalid, a failure indicator (‚ùå) appears but the edit isn't consumed
  - Wrong edits show a failure animation but aren't consumed
  - Discarded edits (when applied away from orders) dissipate with a particle effect

### Conveyor Belt

- Moves from left to right across the screen
- Speed increases gradually over time, up to a maximum
- Orders appear on the left side and exit on the right
- Player must apply edits before orders reach the right edge
- Contains directional arrows showing the flow of orders
- Initial conveyor speed is 0.5 (reduced from 2 for a gentler start)
- Maximum conveyor speed is 3 (reduced from 4 to maintain playability)
- Conveyor exerts a pushing force on the player, pushing them towards the right

## Game Elements

### Stations
- Each station produces a specific type of edit
- **Station Types**:
  1. **Address Edit (üè†)** - For updating delivery address information
  2. **Quantity Edit (üî¢)** - For changing the quantity of items in an order
  3. **Discount Code (üè∑Ô∏è)** - For applying promotional discounts
  4. **Change Product (üîÑ)** - For swapping products in an order
  5. **Need Invoice (üìÑ)** - For adding invoice documentation
  6. **Cancel Order (‚ùå)** - For processing order cancellations

- **Station Unlocking Progression**:
  - Only the first station (Address Edit) is unlocked at the start of the game
  - A new station is unlocked every 5 successfully applied edits
  - Stations unlock in a fixed order (Address ‚Üí Quantity ‚Üí Discount ‚Üí Product ‚Üí Invoice ‚Üí Cancel)
  - When a station unlocks, a notification appears on screen
  - Stations maintain their unlocked state throughout the game session
  - Newly unlocked stations appear with a fade-in and scale animation for emphasis

- **Station Collision**:
  - Stations have robust collision boundaries to prevent player from walking through
  - Collision detection uses precise player and station bounds
  - Tracking previous player position prevents sliding and clipping through stations
  - Player bounds for collision are 28x28 pixels
  - Station bounds are expanded by 4 pixels in each dimension for reliable collision detection

### Orders

- Appear as cardboard boxes with emoji icons showing required edits
- Move from left to right on the conveyor belt
- Orders maintain consistent 40px spacing on the conveyor belt
- Orders never require duplicate edit types
- Orders generation is controlled by a timer with adjustable delays

- **Order Edit Requirements**:
  - Each order requires 1-6 different types of edits
  - As more stations unlock, individual boxes may require multiple edits
  - Multi-edit boxes are interspersed with simpler boxes
  - As the game progresses, the frequency of multi-edit boxes increases
  - Order complexity increases with game progression using a probability system

- **Order Sizes**:
  - Orders have dynamic sizes based on the number of edits required:
    - 1-2 edits: Small box (110px + (numEdits * 10)px width √ó 70px height)
    - 3-4 edits: Medium box (130px + ((numEdits - 2) * 15)px width √ó 75-100px height)
    - 5-6 edits: Large box (160px + ((numEdits - 4) * 20)px width √ó 120px height)

- **Visual Representation**:
  - Orders with 1-3 edits display icons in a horizontal row
  - Orders with 4-6 edits display icons in a grid pattern
  - Checkmarks appear above corresponding icons when edits are applied
  - Multiple edits can be applied to the same order until all required edits are completed
  - Completed orders show a happy wiggle animation and checkmark
  - Failed orders display an angry emoji (üò°) when exiting the screen
  - Completed orders show a heart emoji (‚ù§Ô∏è) when exiting

### Speech Bubbles and Comments

- Orders display speech bubbles with customer comments
- Comments are context-specific to the edit type required
- The system prevents repetition of recently shown comments (tracks last 5)
- Special comments appear during power-up mode
- Comments are designed to be humorous and fit the theme of each edit type
- Speech bubbles disappear when orders move beyond a certain point on the screen

## User Interface Elements

- Appears above the power switch when power-up is active
- Counts down from 30 seconds to 0

### Power-Up Switch
- Located on the right side of the screen
- Features a lever that can be activated by the player
- Visual indication when player is near the switch (flashing)
- Shows a ready indicator when power-up is available
- Switch has precise collision bounds for interaction
- Button flashes with a 1-second interval when ready

## Game Progression

### Difficulty Scaling

The game difficulty increases in 5 stages based on time played:

1. **Stage 0 (Initial)**: Mostly simple 1-2 edit orders (30% chance of 1 edit)
2. **Stage 1 (1 min)**: Slightly harder distribution
3. **Stage 2 (2 min)**: More 3+ edit orders appear
4. **Stage 3 (3 min)**: Fewer simple orders, more complex ones
5. **Stage 4 (4 min)**: Mostly complex orders
6. **Stage 5 (5 min)**: Very challenging distribution (30% chance of 6 edits)

As time progresses:
- Conveyor belt speed gradually increases up to a maximum value (from 0.5 to 3)
- Time between new orders decreases (starting at 5000ms and decreasing to 1500ms minimum)
- Orders move faster across the screen (orderSpeedMultiplier increases from 1.0 to 2.0)
- Each station unlock increases game difficulty slightly

### Lives System
- Player starts with 3 lives, displayed as hearts in the top left corner
- Lives are lost when orders move off the screen before being completed
- The game ends when all lives are lost
- Additional lives can be gained using the F key cheat

## Scoring System

- Base points for applying an edit: 10 points
- Completion bonus: 25 points √ó number of edits in the order
- Higher scores come from completing complex multi-edit orders
- Score is displayed prominently in the wooden sign at the top center

## Visual Feedback

### Order Status Indicators

## Technical Implementation

### Order Generation

```typescript
private generateOrder = () => {
  // Select random edit types from unlocked stations
  const stationTypes = this.stations
    .filter(station => station.isUnlocked)
    .map(station => station.type);
    
  // Ensure we don't have duplicates by using the Fisher-Yates shuffle
  const shuffledTypes = [...stationTypes].sort(() => Math.random() - 0.5);
  
  // Take the first numEdits types (no duplicates)
  const selectedTypes: string[] = [];
  for (let i = 0; i < numEdits && i < shuffledTypes.length; i++) {
    selectedTypes.push(shuffledTypes[i]);
  }
  
  // Dynamic box sizing based on the number of edits
  if (numEdits <= 2) {
    // Small boxes for 1-2 edits
    bgWidth = 110 + (numEdits * 10);
    bgHeight = 70;
  } else if (numEdits <= 4) {
    // Medium boxes for 3-4 edits
    bgWidth = 130 + ((numEdits - 2) * 15);
    bgHeight = numEdits === 3 ? 75 : 100;
  } else {
    // Large boxes for 5-6 edits
    bgWidth = 160 + ((numEdits - 4) * 20);
    bgHeight = 120;
  }
}
```

### Order Complexity System

```typescript
// Determine order complexity based on unlocked stations
const maxPossibleEdits = Math.min(5, unlockedStations.length);

// Probability table for the number of edits (example for 5 unlocked stations)
// Format: [1 edit, 2 edits, 3 edits, 4 edits, 5 edits]
let editProbabilities = [0.3, 0.25, 0.25, 0.15, 0.05];

// Determine number of edits using probability table
const random = Math.random();
let cumulativeProbability = 0;
let numEdits = 1;

for (let i = 0; i < editProbabilities.length; i++) {
  cumulativeProbability += editProbabilities[i];
  if (random <= cumulativeProbability) {
    numEdits = i + 1;
    break;
  }
}
```

### Edit Application System

```typescript
private applyEditToOrder(order: Order) {
  if (this.carriedEdits.length === 0) return false;
  
  // Get the first edit in the queue (FIFO)
  const edit = this.carriedEdits[0];
  
  // Check if the order requires this edit type and it hasn't been applied yet
  if (order.types.includes(edit.type) && !order.completedEdits.includes(edit.type)) {
    // Success! Apply the edit
    order.completedEdits.push(edit.type);
    
    // Create a checkmark to show this edit has been applied
    this.markEditAsApplied(order, edit.type);
    
    // Increment total edits applied (for unlocking stations)
    this.totalEditsApplied++;
    
    // Check if we should unlock a new station (every 5 edits)
    if (this.totalEditsApplied >= 5 && 
        (this.totalEditsApplied - this.lastUnlockedAtEditCount) >= 5) {
      this.unlockNextStation();
    }
    
    // Increase score
    this.score += 10;
    
    // Check if order is now complete
    if (order.completedEdits.length === order.types.length) {
      this.completeOrder(order);
    }
    
    // Remove the used edit
    this.removeFirstEdit();
    
    return true;
  } else {
    // Wrong edit type - show failure feedback
    // ...
  }
}
```

### Lives Display Implementation

```typescript
private updateLivesDisplay() {
  // Clear any existing heart icons
  this.livesContainer.removeAll(true);
  
  // Heart emoji dimensions and positioning
  const heartWidth = 24;
  const spacing = 6;
  
  // Position hearts from left side (disappear from right when lost)
  // Start from the left edge of the container with padding
  const startX = -42; // Left edge of wooden sign with padding
  const yOffset = -10; // Move hearts up by 10px
  
  for (let i = 0; i < this.lives; i++) {
    const heartX = startX + (i * (heartWidth + spacing));
    const heart = this.add.text(
      heartX,
      yOffset, // Apply vertical offset to move hearts up
      '‚ù§Ô∏è',
      { fontSize: '24px' }
    );
    this.livesContainer.add(heart);
  }
  
  // Get parent container (the wooden sign)
  const parent = this.livesContainer.parentContainer;
  
  // If we have more than 3 hearts, resize the background
  if (parent && this.lives > 3) {
    // Calculate the new width based on number of hearts
    const totalWidth = (this.lives * heartWidth) + ((this.lives - 1) * spacing);
    const newWidth = Math.max(110, totalWidth + 24); // Add padding
    
    // Update the sizes of container elements
    shadow.width = newWidth;
    background.width = newWidth;
    texture.width = newWidth;
    
    // Update nail positions at corners
  }
}
```

### Station Unlock Notification System

```typescript
// Create a container for the station unlock notification
this.stationUnlockContainer = this.add.container(width * 0.5, height * 0.4);
this.stationUnlockContainer.setVisible(false);

// Create shadow for depth
const signShadow = this.add.rectangle(4, 4, 500, 60, 0x000000, 0.4).setOrigin(0.5);

// Create dark wood background
const signBackground = this.add.rectangle(0, 0, 500, 60, 0x3A2921).setOrigin(0.5);

// Create wood border (top, right, bottom, left)
const borderTop = this.add.rectangle(0, -30, 500, 4, 0x6B4C3B).setOrigin(0.5, 0.5);
const borderBottom = this.add.rectangle(0, 30, 500, 4, 0x6B4C3B).setOrigin(0.5, 0.5);
const borderLeft = this.add.rectangle(-250, 0, 4, 60, 0x6B4C3B).setOrigin(0.5, 0.5);
const borderRight = this.add.rectangle(250, 0, 4, 60, 0x6B4C3B).setOrigin(0.5, 0.5);

// Create simple end caps for the wooden sign
const leftCap = this.add.rectangle(-250, 0, 12, 40, 0x5C3C2E).setOrigin(0.5, 0.5);
const rightCap = this.add.rectangle(250, 0, 12, 40, 0x5C3C2E).setOrigin(0.5, 0.5);

// Create the text with proper setup
this.stationUnlockText = this.add.text(0, 0, '', {
  fontSize: '22px',
  color: '#ffffff',
  stroke: '#000000',
  strokeThickness: 2,
  align: 'center'
}).setOrigin(0.5);
```

### Order Completion and Animations

```typescript
private completeOrder(order: Order) {
  // Mark as complete
  order.isComplete = true;
  
  // Happy wiggle animation
  this.tweens.add({
    targets: order.container,
    angle: { from: -5, to: 5 },
    duration: 120,
    ease: 'Sine.InOut',
    repeat: 3,
    yoyo: true,
    onComplete: () => {
      order.container.angle = 0;
    }
  });
  
  // Show completion indicator
  const completionEmoji = this.add.text(
    order.container.x,
    order.container.y - 40,
    '‚úÖ',
    { fontSize: '36px', stroke: '#000000', strokeThickness: 2 }
  ).setOrigin(0.5);
  
  // Add it to the container so it moves with the order
  order.container.add(completionEmoji);
}
```

### Player-Station Collision Detection

```typescript
// Track previous position before any movement occurs
const prevX = this.player.x;
const prevY = this.player.y;

// Allow player movement with arrow keys...

// Create precise player bounds for collision detection
const playerBounds = new Phaser.Geom.Rectangle(
  this.player.x - 14,
  this.player.y - 14,
  28,
  28
);

// Check for station collisions
for (const station of this.stations) {
  if (station && station.isUnlocked && station.bounds) {
    const stationBounds = new Phaser.Geom.Rectangle(
      station.bounds.x, station.bounds.y, 
      station.bounds.width, station.bounds.height
    );
    
    // Expand station bounds slightly for more reliable collision detection
    stationBounds.width += 4;
    stationBounds.height += 4;
    stationBounds.x -= 2;
    stationBounds.y -= 2;
    
    if (Phaser.Geom.Rectangle.Overlaps(playerBounds, stationBounds)) {
      // Collision detected - restore previous position
      collision = true;
      break;
    }
  }
}

// If collision occurred, restore previous position
if (collision) {
  this.player.x = prevX;
  this.player.y = prevY;
}
```

### Player Animation System

```typescript
// The updatePlayerAnimation method handles animation frames
private updatePlayerAnimation(time: number) {
  // Animation rate: 8 frames per second = 125ms per frame
  const frameDelay = 125; 
  
  if (time - this.lastFrameTime > frameDelay) {
    // Advance to next frame (looping from 6 back to 1)
    this.currentFrame = this.currentFrame >= 6 ? 1 : this.currentFrame + 1;
    this.lastFrameTime = time;
    
    // Update the texture with the new frame
    this.setPlayerDirectionTexture(this.lastDirection, this.lastMoving);
  }
}
```

### Power-Up System Implementation

```typescript
private updatePowerUp(delta: number) {
  if (this.powerUpActive) {
    // Decrement timer
    this.powerUpTimer -= delta;
    
    // Update countdown text
    const secondsLeft = Math.ceil(this.powerUpTimer / 1000);
    this.powerUpCountdownText.setText(`${secondsLeft}s`);
    
    // Check if power-up has expired
    if (this.powerUpTimer <= 0) {
      this.deactivatePowerUp();
    }
    
    // Auto-complete any existing orders that were created before power-up
    for (const order of this.orders) {
      if (!order.isComplete && !order.createdDuringPowerUp) {
        // Auto-complete logic...
      }
    }
  }
}
```

### Progressive Difficulty System

```typescript
// When unlocking a new station
private unlockNextStation() {
  // Increase game difficulty slightly
  this.orderSpeedMultiplier = Math.min(
    this.maxOrderSpeedMultiplier,
    this.orderSpeedMultiplier + 0.15
  );
  this.conveyorSpeed = Math.min(
    this.maxConveyorSpeed,
    this.conveyorSpeed + 0.25
  );
  this.nextOrderDelay = Math.max(1500, this.nextOrderDelay - 250);
}

// In the update method
// Move orders based on their speed multiplier
order.x += 0.5 * this.orderSpeedMultiplier;

// Conveyor belt pushes the player with increasing force
this.player.x += this.conveyorSpeed;
```

### Station Tracker System

```typescript
// Station Tracker for managing unlocked stations and radio integration
const isStationUnlocked = (stationType: string): boolean => {
  // Always unlock warehouse station
  if (stationType === 'warehouse') {
    return true;
  }
  
  // For all other stations, check the unlocked status
  const stations = getUnlockedStations();
  const isUnlocked = !!stations[stationType];
  return isUnlocked;
};

// Mark a station as unlocked
const unlockStation = (stationType: string): void => {
  const stations = getUnlockedStations();
  
  // Check if already unlocked
  if (stations[stationType] === true) {
    return;
  }
  
  // Update the state
  stations[stationType] = true;
  localStorage.setItem(UNLOCKED_STATIONS_KEY, JSON.stringify(stations));
  
  // Create a custom event to notify radio component
  const event = new CustomEvent('stationUnlocked', { 
    detail: { stationType, timestamp: Date.now() },
    bubbles: true
  });
  
  window.dispatchEvent(event);
}
```

## Common Issues and Fixes

### Player Movement Issues
- **Problem**: Player gets stuck or moves unexpectedly
- **Fix**: Ensure the `lastDirection` and `lastMoving` properties are properly tracked in the update method
- **Key code**: 
```typescript
if (direction !== this.lastDirection || (this.lastMoving !== isMoving)) {
  this.lastDirection = direction;
  this.lastMoving = isMoving;
}
```

### Station Collision Handling
- **Problem**: Player collision with stations doesn't work correctly
- **Solutions**: 
  1. **Save previous position** before applying any movement
  2. **Use precise collision boxes** (28x28 for player, slightly expanded for stations)
  3. **Restore previous position completely** when collision is detected
  4. **Add debug logging** to track collision issues
  
### Visual Content Positioning
- **Problem**: UI elements not aligned correctly
- **Solution**: Use careful positioning with pixel precision
- **Example**: Hearts in the lives display are positioned with exact pixel values (-42px from left edge, -10px vertical offset)

### Radio Play Issues
- **Problem**: Music doesn't continue when radio UI is closed
- **Solution**: Global audio state outside React lifecycle
- **Approach**: Use a global audio element and state that persists across component remounts

## Game Architecture

The game is built using Phaser 3 with TypeScript, consisting of several key components:

1. **Level1Scene**: Main gameplay scene with player, orders, stations, and core mechanics
2. **GameOverScene**: Displays final score and restart option when the game ends
3. **SpeechBubble**: UI component for showing customer comments
4. **Radio**: Music player with unlockable tracks tied to station progress
5. **StationTracker**: Utility for tracking unlocked stations across components

## User Interface Elements

- **Score Display**: Shows current player score in the top corner with wooden sign styling
- **Lives Indicator**: Visual hearts showing remaining lives inside wooden sign container
- **Power-Up Timer**: Countdown display during active power-up
- **Station Signs**: Text labels identifying each edit station
- **Station Unlock Notification**: Announces newly unlocked stations with distinctive wood sign styling
- **Radio Button**: Toggle for displaying/hiding the music player interface
