# Music & Stations Fix - Order Editing: The Game

## Issues Fixed

1. **Music Not Autoplaying on Refresh**: Fixed by adding multiple methods to ensure music plays when the page loads.
2. **Edit Stations Not Appearing on Game Restart**: Fixed by ensuring stations are properly reinitialized when restarting the game with spacebar.

## Implementation Details

### Music Autoplay Fixes

- Added direct `forcePlayMusic` event dispatch in multiple key locations:
  - In the App component using DOMContentLoaded and load events
  - In the Level1Scene when the game scene is created
  - In the GameOverScene when the user presses spacebar
  - Debug keybinding 'M' to manually trigger music playback

### Station Visibility Fixes

- Added a custom `gameRestartWithStations` event that is dispatched when:
  - The user presses spacebar at the game over screen
  - Debug keybinding 'S' to manually reset stations
  
- The Radio component handles this event by:
  - Reinitializing stations from storage
  - Forcing UI updates with a small delay
  - Ensuring the global state is correctly synced

### Code Organization Improvements

- Restored original event handlers that were accidentally removed
- Fixed the stationTracker integration with explicit calls to `initializeStations`
- Added comprehensive error handling with try/catch blocks
- Enhanced debugging with more console logs

## Debug Features

Added keybindings to help troubleshoot any future issues:
- Press 'M' to force music playback
- Press 'S' to force station reinitialization

## Notes

These changes ensure that:
1. Background music plays on page refresh
2. Edit stations appear correctly when restarting after game over
3. All components communicate properly during game state changes

The solution uses custom events to coordinate between components, making it more maintainable and easier to debug.
